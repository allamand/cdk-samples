# cdk-samples in TypeScript

A curated list of AWS CDK samples in **TypeScript**. 

Make sure you run `npm install` to instrall required packages defined in `packages.json` and `npm run build` to compile typescript to javascript.

For example:

```bash
$ cd cdk-samples/typescript
# install the latest aws-cdk in typescript
$ npm i -g aws-cdk
# install all required packages
$ npm i
# run 'cdk bootstrap' to generate the staging s3 bucket(only for the 1st time)
$ cdk bootstrap

```

# Available Sample Libraries

check the list defined in the [factory](https://github.com/pahud/cdk-samples/blob/2c253c2e9293c72de47e4150d3a7d333648567cd/typescript/bin/cdk-samples.ts#L28)

# Deploy Stack(s)

As all stack classes are imported into a single [cdk-samples.ts](bin/cdk-samples.ts) yet will not initiate the object unless you enable it. That being said, you need enable the stack before you can deploy it, e.g.

```bash
# enable and deploy the EksStack 
cdk diff EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack   
cdk deploy EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack
# in some cases, you might need enable multiple stacks
cdk diff 'Eks*' -c enable_stack=EksStack,EksFargate
```

Some Stacks are also using an environnement configuration file, you can copy the sample `cp .env.template .env` and edit the values.

There is a Makefile that can help launching cdk using the values from the `.env` file:

```
 make deploy STACK=EksStack  
 #or
 make diff STACK=StatefulCluster
```

# Deploy in the default VPC or any existing VPC

You may deploy the stack in your existing VPC to save the deployment time
```bash

# enable and deploy the EksStack in my default vpc
cdk deploy EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack -c use_default_vpc=1
# enable and deploy the EksStack in vpc-123456
cdk deploy EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack -c use_vpc_id=vpc-123456
```

> or just put the use_vps_id in the .env file

# Deploy with different AWS_PROFILE

```bash
cdk --profile another diff EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack
```
# Deploy into a different AWS region

```bash
# let's presume the default region is us-east-1 and we are deploying to ap-northeast-1
AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 cdk diff EksStack -c enable_stack=EksStack
```
 
 # Testing

 The stack had some unitary tests which are configured with the `.env.template` file.

 you can execute them with 

 ```bash
 make test
 ```


# Available NPM Packages

The following samples were published in npmjs as a standalone package you may import as a CDK construct library. Most of them are still in a very early stage and not recommended for production.
